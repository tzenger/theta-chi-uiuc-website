    <h5>Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
    <hr class="my-4" />
    <h6>"Why should I join?"</h6>
    <p>
      Greek life is a timeless tradition at the University of Illinois with
      countless benefits, both social and professional. You will be given the
      opportunity to join a brotherhood and build bonds and friendships that
      last a lifetime. Joining Theta Chi means joining a tradition that is over
      100 years old, a fraternity whose roots extend back to the very first
      fraternities on campus, and a brotherhood that is there for each and every
      one of its members.
    </p>
  </div>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <div>
    <h6>"Are there live-in requirements?"</h6>
    <p>
      Yes. First-year students are required to live-in their sophomore and
      junior year. This may seem long at first but the immersion within the
      fraternity will not only strengthen your bonds with other brothers, but
      will also provide a living experience that is unparalleled to anything
      else… Oh, and we have one of the nicest fraternity houses on campus. Did
      we mention that yet?
    </p>
  </div>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <div>
    <h6>"What leadership opportunities are there?"</h6>
    <p>
      Rho Chapter encourages all of our new members to run for positions within
      the house. These positions provide integral leadership, organizational,
      and communication skills that can be very useful once you graduate.
    </p>
  </div>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <div>
    <h6>"What is expected from me?"</h6>
    <p>
      Brothers of Rho Chapter are expected to exemplify the ideals and values of
      Theta Chi. This carries with you wherever you go: in the classroom, at
      philanthropy events, at sorority mixers, and even at work. Joining Rho
      Chapter will give you the tools and the people you need to learn and
      become the resolute man we all strive to be.
    </p>
  </div>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <div>
    <h6>"How will Theta Chi affect my academics?"</h6>
    <p>
      College can be one of the most daunting experiences a young man like
      yourself will go through. Theta Chi hopes to help all of our new members
      adjust to the academic rigors of college through scholarship reward
      systems, multiple study groups, and a variety of other tried-and-true
      methods. The brothers of Theta Chi come from a wide variety of majors and
      backgrounds, ranging from Finance and Economics, to Industrial Design and
      Kinesiology, to the many engineering practices within the College of
      Engineering.
    </p>
  </div>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <div>
    <h6>"How much will it cost?"</h6>
    <p>
      Theta Chi has one of the lowest dues on campus – as well as brand new
      chapter house. We pride ourselves on effective budgeting, which helps to
      maximize the benefits you get for joining, social events with sororities,
      and countless other on-campus opportunities such as intra-fraternity
      sports leagues and sorority philanthropy events.
